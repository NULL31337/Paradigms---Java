# Paradigms + Java
1 and 2 and 4 term Java, Clojure and JS.

My code in folders paradigms and prog-intro and java-advanced. 

For testing or launching code maybe need base files in paradigms-2021 and prog-intro-2020 and java-advanced-2022 folders. 

Main tasks in HTML files. 

Modification for my group in README.md files (38-39 group).
